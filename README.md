# RGB-Matrix-Control-Website
A website which I am creating to connect to a Raspberry Pi as an MQTT broker.

This website is coded in Flask, and is meant to send an image or gif link from the internet to a RaspberryPi to then display that image on an RGB matrix. It is best displayed with images/gifs in a 4:1 ratio, because the matrix itself is 8x32.

Functional as of 05/03/2022. It will be hosted briefly on my personal deployment testing domain, www.jfed.xyz, for demonstration.

This is the frontend/UI portion of https://github.com/aedlebeck/RPI-RGBMatrix-MQTT, which I collaborated with https://github.com/aedlebeck in creating. The site only works if it is used in conjunction with his portion of the project.
